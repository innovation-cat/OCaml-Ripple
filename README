OCaml-Ripple
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ripple simulation with OCaml and glMLite

Prerequisite:
	1. make sure you have installed OCaml (4.0) and glMLite, glMLite is a package which provide OpenGL bindings for OCaml, 
	   for more detail about glMLite, please refer to:
	   http://www.linux-nantes.org/~fmonnier/ocaml/GL/index.html
	
	2. make sure your graphic card support OpenGL 4.0. 

Abstract:
	when rain drop touch wather, it would becomes a wave source, waves superposition for multiple ripples is time-consuming, here, I use GPU parallel technique to implement.
